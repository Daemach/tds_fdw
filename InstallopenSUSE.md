## Installing on openSUSE

This document will show how to install tds_fdw on openSUSE Leap 15.1. Other openSUSE and SUSE distributions should be similar. 

### Install FreeTDS

The TDS foreign data wrapper requires a library that implements the DB-Library interface,
such as [FreeTDS](http://www.freetds.org).

```bash
sudo zypper install freetds freetds-dev
```

### Install PostgreSQL

If you need to install PostgreSQL, for example, 10.X:

```bash
sudo zypper install postgresql10 postgresql10-server postgresql10-devel
```
